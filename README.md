# Work Connect Bot

## Installation

This bot runs on `node.js`. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/) for npm to use.

Run `npm install` in the bot directory and make sure it passes.

Now set up your `.evn.development` and run `npm run dev` to test the bot out in a development environment!

Your `.env.development` file would look like this:

```js
TOKEN = your_token;
PREFIX = your_prefix;
```
